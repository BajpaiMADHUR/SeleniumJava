Here is the final script in Selenium using WebDriver to automate any given website. 
It can press buttons, scroll down and do almost everything that a manual hand will do.

NOTE: In the attached code, the website used is specially designed for testing purpose.
      There is no logical error in the code whatsoever. Just the Chrome driver version may needs to be updated when you will run the script. 
      Make sure to get the latest version of the Webdriver, everything is fine :)
